# Project Overview: Climate Impact Analysis on LaGuardia Airport

## Project Context
Our team of six is participating in the Agent Development Kit Hackathon, focusing on the "Data Analysis and Insights" category. We aim to leverage multi-agent systems to analyze and present meaningful insights about climate change impacts on coastal infrastructure.

## Focus Area
We have chosen to investigate the combined effects of rising sea levels and land subsidence on LaGuardia Airport in New York City. This focus was selected due to:
* Recent news coverage of flooding incidents at the airport
* The airport's critical role in New York's transportation infrastructure
* The vulnerability of coastal airports to climate change impacts

## Project Goals
Our project will:
* Analyze historical and projected water level changes affecting LaGuardia Airport
* Assess the impact of land subsidence on the airport's infrastructure
* Evaluate the relationship between these factors and recent flooding incidents
* Provide insights into potential future impacts on airport operations and travel
