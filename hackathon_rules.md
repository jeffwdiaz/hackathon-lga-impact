## What to Build

Your project should demonstrate how to design and orchestrate interactions between multiple autonomous agents using ADK. Build your solutions within one of the following categories:

* **Automation of Complex Processes:** Design multi-agent workflows to automate complex, multi-step business processes, software development lifecycle, or manage intricate tasks.
* **Data Analysis and Insights:** Create multi-agent systems that autonomously analyze data from various sources, derive meaningful insights using tools like BigQuery, and collaboratively present findings.
* **Customer Service and Engagement:** Develop intelligent virtual assistants or support agents built with ADK as multi-agent systems to handle complex customer inquiries, provide personalized support, and proactively engage with customers.
* **Content Creation and Generation:** Build multi-agent systems that can autonomously generate different forms of content, such as marketing materials, reports, or code, by orchestrating agents with specialized content generation capabilities.

## Requirements

* Your project must be built using Agent Development Kit and you must focus on the design and orchestration of interactions between multiple agents using ADK.
* While ADK is foundational, you are allowed and encouraged to enhance your solutions by integrating with other relevant technologies and frameworks within the Google Cloud ecosystem.
* The project must be capable of being successfully installed and must function as depicted in the video and/or expressed in the text description.

## What to Submit

* Include a URL to the hosted Project for judging and testing.
* Include a text description that includes a summary of the Project's features and functionality, technologies used, information about any other data sources used, and your findings and learnings as you worked through the project. Written parts of entries must be in English to be eligible. The Submission must, at a minimum, support English language use.
* Include a URL to your public code repository to show how your project was built. The code repository must be public to allow access for judging and testing. By submitting this code, you confirm you have the authority and right to share the code for the purposes described in this Contest.
* Include an Architecture Diagram showing which technologies were used and how they interact with one another.
* Include a demonstration video of your Project. The video portion of the submission must meet the following criteria:
    * Should include footage that shows the Project functioning on the platform(s) for which it was built.
    * No parts of the submission can be derogatory, offensive, threatening, defamatory, disparaging, libelous or contain any content that is inappropriate, indecent, sexual, profane, indecent, tortuous, slanderous, discriminatory in any way, or that promotes hatred or harm against any group or person, or otherwise does not comply with the theme and spirit of the Contest.
    * No part of that submission contains content, material or any element that is unlawful, or otherwise in violation of or contrary to all applicable federal, state, or local laws and regulations in any country, state or applicable territory where you created the video and in the United States.

    * It must be in English or include English subtitles.

## Judging Criteria
